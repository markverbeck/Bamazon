BAMAZON.

This is a Node.JS application that is a fictional "amazon" server that lets you use the data base as a "customer" and a "manager".

Customer.

Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale. Include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale.
The app should then prompt users with two messages.

The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

Once the customer has placed the order, your application should check if your store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.

Manager.

List a set of menu options:
View Products for Sale
View Low Inventory
Add to Inventory
Add New Product
